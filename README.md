# Todo App

## Assessment for Revent

This is a basic todo application that enables a user to add, delete, or update a todo status. The state of the application is persisted with local storage.

## Questions
Answers to assessment questions are included in the ``answers.md`` file.

## useFetch Hook
The ``useFetch()`` hook is defined in the **hooks** folder and displayed via ``PlaceholderTodos.tsx`` page. You can access this page via the application by hitting the ``Use Fetch`` link on the navbar. 

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Users can add new todos to the list.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can remove todos from the list.
- **Update Todo Status**: Users can mark todos as completed, not-started or in-progress.
- **Local Storage**: The application state is saved in the browser's local storage, so todos persist even after refreshing the page.
